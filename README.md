Marcelo Ferreira Londero

The object of this repo is submit a tidy data as requisite to complete the Getting and Cleaning Data Course

### Summary
This project is useful to train the ability of collect and clean a data set and transform it in a tidy data set that can be used for further analysis.

### Code objective
The code's objective is to getting the data, keep just the variables which contains 'mean' and 'std' in its names and calculate the mean of each variable grouping for two other variables.

###  Step by step of the code
The following are the overview steps the code executes:

You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 
#####1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
#####2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
#####3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
#####4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
#####5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
